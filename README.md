# Unnamed-lang
A programming language compiler built using C. For learning purposes only!

Currently can fully compile an exit syscall. More to come in the future!

The goal of the language is to be able to write FizzBuzz properly (as a minimum, it may go beyond that).
This means a few things will have to be implemented, which will be usable for many other projects.

So, at a minimum there will be these features,\
Writing to console,\
Some form of loops,\
Mod operator,\
If statements.

Once that is achieved I will decide whether to continue developing or not.
