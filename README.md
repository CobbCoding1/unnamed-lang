# Unnamed-lang
A programming language compiler built using C. For learning purposes only!

The goal of this language was to compile FizzBuzz entirely, which meant writing to stdout, loops, mod operator, and if statements were required, which were all implemented.
To see how the syntax looks, checks the examples folder.

The project is not planned to go any further than its current state.

Was all streamed live on Twitch, and the VODs are available on my YouTube.
